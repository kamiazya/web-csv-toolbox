# Execution Strategies

This document explains how different execution strategies work and when to use each one.

## Background

CSV parsing can be a performance bottleneck, especially when dealing with large files. The performance requirements vary significantly depending on the runtime environment:

**Browser Context:**
- **UI Responsiveness**: Parsing on the main thread occupies the thread, preventing user interactions and causing the UI to freeze
- **User Experience**: Users expect smooth, responsive applications even when processing large datasets
- **Memory Constraints**: Mobile devices and older hardware have limited memory

**Server Context (Node.js, Deno, Bun):**
- **Throughput**: Need to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently
- **CPU Utilization**: Can leverage multiple cores for parallel processing
- **Memory Management**: Large files can exhaust server memory if not handled properly

web-csv-toolbox addresses these challenges through flexible execution strategies that work across all JavaScript runtimes.

## Overview

web-csv-toolbox supports multiple execution strategies that can be combined for optimal performance:

1. **Main Thread** - Traditional synchronous parsing
2. **Worker Threads** - Offload parsing to background threads
3. **WebAssembly** - High-performance WASM parsing
4. **Combined** - Worker + WASM for maximum performance

## Main Thread Execution

### How It Works

Parsing runs synchronously on the main thread (browser) or event loop (Node.js/Deno/Bun), occupying it and preventing other operations until completion.

- **In Browsers**: The main thread cannot respond to user interactions or update the UI while parsing
- **On Servers**: The event loop is occupied by CSV processing, reducing throughput for other requests

### Characteristics

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No initialization overhead
- ✅ Simple and straightforward
- ✅ Works everywhere
- ✅ Lower latency for small files

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Occupies the main thread/event loop
- ❌ **Browser**: UI freezes during parsing
- ❌ **Server**: Reduces throughput for concurrent requests

### When to Use

- Small CSV files (< 1MB)
- Server-side processing where UI doesn't matter
- Quick scripts or prototypes
- When worker overhead is unacceptable

### Example

```typescript
import { parse } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Runs on main thread (default)
for await (const record of parse(csv)) {
  console.log(record);
}
```

## Worker Thread Execution

### How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread<br/>(UI Events & Rendering)
    participant Worker as Worker Thread<br/>(Parsing)

    Main->>Worker: Send CSV data
    activate Worker
    Note over Main: UI stays responsive ✓
    Worker->>Worker: Parse CSV
    Worker-->>Main: Send records
    Worker-->>Main: Send results
    deactivate Worker
    Note over Main: Render results
```

Parsing is offloaded to a separate worker thread, keeping the main thread free.

### Message Streaming Strategy

**How It Works:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread
    participant Worker as Worker Thread

    Main->>Worker: postMessage(CSV data)
    activate Worker
    Worker->>Main: postMessage(record 1)
    Worker->>Main: postMessage(record 2)
    Worker->>Main: postMessage(record 3)
    deactivate Worker
    Note over Worker,Main: Records sent one by one<br/>via postMessage
```

Records are sent one by one via [**postMessage**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage) API.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Works on all browsers (including Safari)
- ✅ Reliable and well-tested
- ⚠️ Some serialization overhead
- ⚠️ Memory copies for each message

**Best For:**
- Medium files (1-10MB)
- When Safari support is required
- When maximum compatibility is needed

### Stream Transfer Strategy

**How It Works:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread
    participant Worker as Worker Thread

    Main->>Worker: Transfer ReadableStream<br/>(zero-copy)
    activate Worker
    Note over Worker: Parse stream
    Worker-->>Main: Transfer result stream<br/>(zero-copy)
    deactivate Worker
    Main->>Main: Read records
    Note over Main,Worker: Transferable Streams<br/>No memory copies
```

The entire stream is transferred to the worker using Transferable Streams.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Zero-copy transfer (very efficient)
- ✅ Constant memory usage
- ✅ Best for large streaming workloads
- ❌ Not supported on Safari

**Best For:**
- Large streaming files (> 10MB)
- Memory-sensitive applications
- Chrome, Firefox, Edge browsers (Safari will auto-fallback to message-streaming)

### Runtime Support

For detailed information about supported environments and browser compatibility, see **[Supported Environments](../reference/supported-environments.md)**.

**Quick Summary:**
- ✅ **Node.js LTS**: Full support with Worker Threads
- ✅ **Deno LTS**: Full support with Web Workers
- ✅ **Chrome/Firefox/Edge**: Full support including Transferable Streams
- ⚠️ **Safari**: Supported with automatic fallback (no Transferable Streams)
- ⚠️ **Bun**: Community support (untested)

**Note:** Safari automatically falls back to message-streaming when Transferable Streams are not available. See [Automatic Fallback Behavior](#automatic-fallback-behavior) for details.

### Platform Differences

Worker execution works across different JavaScript runtimes with platform-specific implementations:

**Browser (Web Workers)**
```typescript
import { parseString, EnginePresets } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

for await (const record of parseString(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.balanced
})) {
  console.log(record);
  // UI stays responsive!
}
```
- Runs in separate memory space for full isolation
- Worker initialization overhead exists
- Best for: UI-responsive web applications

**Node.js (Worker Threads)**
```typescript
import { parseString, EnginePresets } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Worker threads are used automatically
for await (const record of parseString(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.balanced
})) {
  console.log(record);
}
```
- Uses `node:worker_threads` internally (Node.js LTS)
- Shared V8 instance for lower memory overhead
- Worker initialization overhead exists (lower than browser)
- Best for: Server-side concurrent processing

**Deno (Web Workers)**
- Uses standard Web Workers API
- Native TypeScript support
- Similar characteristics to browser workers
- Best for: Web standards-compatible server applications

For detailed platform specifications and compatibility information, see **[Supported Environments](../reference/supported-environments.md)**.

### Automatic Fallback Behavior

web-csv-toolbox automatically falls back to more compatible execution methods when the requested strategy is not available. This behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled with [strict mode](../reference/engine-config.md#strict-mode).

**Stream Transfer → Message Streaming:**
- Occurs when the browser doesn't support Transferable Streams (e.g., Safari)
- Automatically uses message-streaming without errors
- No code changes required

**Example (Default - with auto-fallback):**
```typescript
import { parseString, EnginePresets } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Request stream-transfer strategy
for await (const record of parseString(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.workerStreamTransfer()
})) {
  console.log(record);
}
// On Safari: Automatically falls back to message-streaming
// On Chrome/Firefox/Edge: Uses stream-transfer as requested
```

**Example (Strict mode - no fallback):**
```typescript
import { parseString } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Strict mode: throw error if stream-transfer not supported
for await (const record of parseString(csv, {
  engine: {
    worker: true,
    workerStrategy: 'stream-transfer',
    strict: true  // Disable automatic fallback
  }
})) {
  console.log(record);
}
// On Safari: Throws an error
// On Chrome/Firefox/Edge: Uses stream-transfer as requested
```

**When to use strict mode:**
- Testing/debugging to ensure specific strategy is used
- When you need to guarantee a specific execution method
- When you want to explicitly handle unsupported features

For more details, see [Engine Configuration - Strict Mode](../reference/engine-config.md#strict-mode).

### When to Use Workers

✅ **Use workers when:**
- File size > 1MB
- **Browser**: UI responsiveness is critical
- **Server**: Processing multiple files concurrently
- **Server**: Spare CPU cores available for parallel processing

❌ **Skip workers when:**
- Small file size
- Worker initialization overhead is unacceptable for your use case
- Simple scripts or command-line tools
- Very tight latency requirements

### Example

**Browser (UI responsiveness):**
```typescript
import { parse, EnginePresets } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Worker with message streaming (Safari compatible)
for await (const record of parse(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.worker
})) {
  console.log(record);
  // UI stays responsive!
}

// Worker with stream transfer (best for Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
for await (const record of parse(response, {
  engine: EnginePresets.workerStreamTransfer()
})) {
  console.log(record);
  // Zero-copy streaming!
}
```

**Server (concurrent processing):**
```typescript
import { parseStringStream, WorkerPool } from 'web-csv-toolbox';
import { createReadStream } from 'node:fs';
import { Readable } from 'node:stream';

// Create worker pool for handling multiple files
using pool = new WorkerPool({ maxWorkers: 4 });

// Process multiple CSV files concurrently with streaming
await Promise.all(
  csvFiles.map(async (filePath) => {
    // Stream file from disk
    const fileStream = createReadStream(filePath, 'utf-8');
    const webStream = Readable.toWeb(fileStream);

    let processedCount = 0;
    for await (const record of parseStringStream(webStream, {
      engine: { worker: true, workerPool: pool }
    })) {
      // Process each record without loading all into memory
      await processRecord(record);  // e.g., insert to database
      processedCount++;
    }

    console.log(`Processed ${processedCount} records from ${filePath}`);
  })
);

async function processRecord(record) {
  // Process individual record (e.g., database insert, validation, etc.)
  // Records are not accumulated in memory
}
```

## WebAssembly Execution

### How It Works

Parsing uses pre-compiled WebAssembly code for 2-3x faster performance compared to JavaScript.

- **In Browsers**: Faster than JavaScript, but still occupies the main thread
- **On Servers**: Faster parsing with lower CPU usage, but still occupies the event loop

### Why WASM is Faster

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Interpreted/JIT compiled at runtime
function parseCSV(text) {
  // Character-by-character processing
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
    const char = text[i];
    // ... complex logic ...
  }
}
```

**WebAssembly:**
```wasm
;; Pre-compiled to machine code
(func $parse_csv
  ;; Optimized low-level operations
  ;; Direct memory access
  ;; SIMD instructions
)
```

**Performance Gains:**
- 2-3x faster parsing
- Lower CPU usage
- More efficient memory access

### Characteristics

**Advantages:**
- ✅ 2-3x faster than JavaScript
- ✅ Lower CPU usage
- ✅ Predictable performance
- ✅ Small binary size (~50KB)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ UTF-8 encoding only
- ❌ Double-quote (`"`) only
- ❌ Still occupies main thread/event loop
- ❌ Requires `loadWASM()` call

### Limitations

#### UTF-8 Only

```typescript
// ✅ Works
parse(utf8CSV, { engine: { wasm: true } });

// ❌ Won't work
parse(shiftJISCSV, {
  charset: 'shift-jis',
  engine: { wasm: true }
});
```

#### Double-Quote Only

```typescript
// ✅ Works
parse('a,"b,c",d', { engine: { wasm: true } });

// ❌ Won't work
parse("a,'b,c',d", {
  quotation: "'",
  engine: { wasm: true }
});
```

### When to Use WASM

✅ **Use WASM when:**
- Files are UTF-8 encoded
- Using standard CSV format (double-quotes)
- Performance is critical
- **Browser**: CPU usage matters (battery-powered devices, mobile)
- **Server**: High-throughput parsing with lower CPU overhead

❌ **Skip WASM when:**
- Non-UTF-8 encoding (e.g., Shift-JIS, EUC-JP)
- Custom quotation characters
- Broad format support needed
- WASM initialization overhead is unacceptable

### Example

```typescript
import { parse, EnginePresets, loadWASM } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

// Load WASM module once at startup
await loadWASM();

// Parse with WASM (2-3x faster)
for await (const record of parse(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.wasm
})) {
  console.log(record);
}
```

## Combined: Worker + WASM

### How It Works

**In Browsers:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread<br/>(UI Events & Rendering)
    participant Worker as Worker Thread<br/>(WASM Parser)

    Main->>Worker: Send CSV data
    activate Worker
    Note over Main: UI stays responsive ✓
    Worker->>Worker: WASM Parse<br/>(2-3x faster)
    Worker-->>Main: Send results
    deactivate Worker
    Note over Main: Render results
    Note over Main,Worker: Fast + Non-blocking
```

**On Servers:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EventLoop as Event Loop<br/>(HTTP Requests)
    participant Worker as Worker Thread<br/>(WASM Parser)

    EventLoop->>Worker: Send CSV data
    activate Worker
    Note over EventLoop: Can handle other requests ✓
    Worker->>Worker: WASM Parse<br/>(2-3x faster)
    Worker-->>EventLoop: Send results
    deactivate Worker
    Note over EventLoop: Process results
    Note over EventLoop,Worker: Fast + High throughput
```

Combines the benefits of both strategies:
- Worker offloading (keeps main thread/event loop free)
- WASM acceleration (2-3x faster parsing)

### Characteristics

**Advantages:**
- ✅ 2-3x faster than JavaScript
- ✅ **Browser**: Non-blocking UI, smooth user experience
- ✅ **Server**: High throughput, can handle concurrent requests
- ✅ Best overall performance
- ✅ Good for large files

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ UTF-8 encoding only
- ❌ Double-quote (`"`) only
- ❌ Worker + WASM initialization overhead
- ❌ Requires `loadWASM()` call

### When to Use Combined

✅ **Use combined when:**
- Large UTF-8 files (> 10MB)
- **Browser**: UI responsiveness + performance both critical
- **Server**: High-throughput processing with concurrent requests
- Standard CSV format (UTF-8, double-quotes)

❌ **Skip combined when:**
- Non-UTF-8 encoding required
- File size < 1MB (overhead not worth it)
- Maximum compatibility needed
- Simple single-file processing

### Example

```typescript
import { parse, EnginePresets, loadWASM } from 'web-csv-toolbox';

await loadWASM();

// Best of both worlds
for await (const record of parse(csv, {
  engine: EnginePresets.fastest()  // Worker + WASM + stream-transfer
})) {
  console.log(record);
  // Fast + non-blocking!
}
```

## Performance Comparison

### Benchmark Results

Based on a 10MB CSV file with 100,000 records (browser environment):

<!-- TODO: Add actual performance measurements from benchmarks -->

| Strategy | Parse Time | Main Thread/Event Loop | Memory | CPU Usage |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|-----------|
| Main Thread | Baseline | ❌ Occupied | Moderate | High |
| Worker (message) | Baseline + overhead | ✅ Free | Moderate | High |
| Worker (stream) | Baseline + overhead | ✅ Free | Moderate | High |
| WASM | Faster | ❌ Occupied | Lower | Moderate |
| Worker + WASM | Faster + overhead | ✅ Free | Moderate | Moderate |

**Key Insights:**
- WASM provides faster parsing
- Worker has initialization overhead
- Stream transfer is more memory efficient than message passing
- Worker + WASM combines benefits of parallelization and speed

**Note:** Actual performance varies by hardware, runtime, and CSV complexity. See [CodSpeed benchmarks](https://codspeed.io/kamiazya/web-csv-toolbox) for measured results.

### Memory Characteristics

#### Main Thread / WASM
```
Memory: O(n) - proportional to file size
```

#### Worker (Message Streaming)
```
Memory: O(n) + overhead for message copies
```

#### Worker (Stream Transfer)
```
Memory: O(1) - constant per record (streaming)
```

### By Requirements

**Browser - Need UI responsiveness?**
→ Use worker (`balanced`, `worker`, `fastest`)

**Server - Need high throughput?**
→ Use worker with pool (`balanced`, `fastest`)

**Need maximum speed?**
→ Use WASM (`wasm`, `fastest`)

**Need broad format support (non-UTF-8, custom quotes)?**
→ Avoid WASM (`balanced`, `worker`, `mainThread`)

**Browser - Safari support required?**
→ Use message-streaming (`worker`, not `workerStreamTransfer`)

**Need maximum compatibility?**
→ Use `mainThread` (works everywhere)

### By Environment

**Browser (UI-critical):**
→ `balanced` or `fastest` (keep UI responsive)

**Node.js/Deno/Bun (server-side):**
→ `balanced` with `WorkerPool` (concurrent processing)

**Safari:**
→ `worker` or `balanced` (auto-fallback to message-streaming)

**Chrome/Firefox/Edge:**
→ `fastest` or `workerStreamTransfer` (zero-copy streams)

**CLI tools / Scripts:**
→ `mainThread` or `wasm` (no worker overhead)

 * A pool that creates transient workers which are automatically terminated after each job.
 *
 * This pool is designed for the default worker pool to prevent workers from staying alive
 * and blocking process exit. Each worker is terminated immediately after the job completes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Design Rationale:**
 *
 * Unlike {@link ReusableWorkerPool} which keeps workers alive for reuse, `TransientWorkerPool`
 * terminates workers after each job. This is specifically designed for the internal default pool
 * to avoid requiring users to call `terminateWorkers()` for process cleanup.
 *
 * **Characteristics:**
 * - Workers are created on-demand
 * - Workers are terminated immediately after job completion
 * - No persistent worker instances
 * - Prevents process from hanging due to active workers

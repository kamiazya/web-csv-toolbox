# Prevent execution of install scripts to mitigate malicious code execution

ignore-scripts=true

# Whitelist specific packages that require build scripts
# Add packages here that legitimately need to run scripts (e.g., native modules)
# Currently this project builds WASM from source, which doesn't require npm scripts
# If you need to allow scripts for specific packages, use:
# onlyBuiltDependencies[]=package-name
